# DND-rpg

this is my personal project where i create a turn based RPG with spells and make it run within a website and HOPEFULLY a dice roll mechanic at the moment I am working on the spell system for my game as it is in a broken state.



Turn - based RPG in a website

Using the Django and pygame framework I will create a turn-based rpg which would be text based. I will try to use animations to show attacks being displayed but that may or may not be possible with the Django framework. Itâ€™ll be hosted within a website or browser but I am still thinking about it

language(s) used = python, maybe CSS and HTML and Java

Client = Aimed at younger users that do not have access to high level games due to hardware limitations, by making it within a website its free to use and easily accessible

My goal is to create a turn based game with an enemy AI that randomly chooses between its spells and attacks. I may or add features such as the ability to skip an opponents turn
I want to add an element of chance such as the potential of critical hits, dealing double damage.
Or Damage Over Time effects



Success criteria:

- Get a website working
- Get the game to run in the website
- Ensure the game runs as intended
- Attacks register, damage is correct, spells deal the correct effects,
- Turns aren't accidentally skipped
- The website can allow for mouse input such as clicking, instead of needing a number input from the user.


Making the enemy choose randomly between their attacks as well as being able to choose your character, the difficulty you play on as well as the enemy you fight allows the user to have multiple ways of playing the game. Having it in a website allows for easy access and shouldn't need powerful software to be able to run it as it will be text based.
